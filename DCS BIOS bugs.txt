		defineRotary("PLT_SAI_PITCH_TRIM", 13, 3002, 619, "PLT SAI", "Pilot SAI Cage Knob, (MW) Adjust aircraft reference symbol")
	doesn't work.  However this works:
		defineRotary("PLT_SAI_PITCH_TRIM", 13, 3004, 619, "PLT SAI", "Pilot SAI Cage Knob, (MW) Adjust aircraft reference symbol")
	In command_defs.lua, 3002 refers to CageKnobPull, and 3004 refers to CageKnobRotate_ITER

	FRONT GPU Button is listed twice, once for "FRONT_ABORT" (actually the ABORT START switch) and once for "FRONT_GPU" (the correct button)
	'FRONT_BAK_ADI_CAGE_BNT' should probably be 'BTN'

	ENG_ROTOR_BREAK should be ENG_ROTOR_BRAKE

	"Canopy" instead of 'CANOPY"

	Something is messed up with the F-5's IFF panel controls...  Doesn't seem to be a way to turn the IFF Master Mode knob, and some of the controls are not shown correctly in the Chrome App (haven't tried in Bort though).
	CHAFF_MODE and FLARE_MODE_SEL, inconsistent naming
	SAI_PITCH_TRIM control seems to need the value to increase (or maybe decrease) in size each time its called in order to move the control repeatedly.

	"Emergency Govenor Switch" label
